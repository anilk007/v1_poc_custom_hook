This is POC for React Custom Hook.

There are several advantages to using Custom Hooks:

Reusability — we can use the same custom hook again and again, without the need to write it twice.

\src\shared\custom_hooks\useFetch.jsx can be reused for rest API communication.

Clean Code — extracting all the component logic into a hook will provide a cleaner codebase.

Maintainability — easier to maintain. if we need to change the logic of the hook, we only need to change it once.

Great Community — The web is filled with a ton of Custom Hooks! you can find a hook for your need and use it as-is or even better — you can use it as a starting point and make it awesome!
